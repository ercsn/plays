FURNISHING SANITY

PLACE AND TIME
Nondescript room with tables and chairs. Modern day.


CHARACTER BREAKDOWN (2)

PAT (M/F): A meticulous table whisperer whose unwavering adherence to prescribed routines masks a fracturing grip on reality.
LYNN (M/F): A charismatic therapist whose calm empathy conceals an unsettling investment in her unconventional methods.




SYNOPSIS:
Pat — a table whisperer whose strict adherence to mysterious rules hints at deeper turmoil — is unexpectedly drawn into a group session led by Lynn, a charismatic furniture whisperer challenging everything he thought he knew about healing.




Lights up on PAT alone, both hands pressed flat against a table, eyes closed. His lips move silently. He's been here a while.

LYNN enters, notebook in hand. She watches Pat for a moment—clinical, curious—then sits at a nearby table surrounded by chairs. She begins writing.

Pat opens his eyes. Sees Lynn. His hands leave the table reluctantly, fingers trailing across the surface.

PAT
Excuse me, do you mind?

Lynn stops writing and looks up at Pat.

LYNN
Do I mind what?

PAT
(Motions to the table)
I've got some work to do.

LYNN
Welcome to the club.

PAT
No... I mean—
(He touches his collar, adjusts it. Adjusts it again.)
I have work to do with this table.

LYNN
With this table?

PAT
I know this is an inconvenience. But I need you to leave me alone with this table.

LYNN
Alone with this table?

PAT
There are other tables. Great tables! Like that one over there.

LYNN
Sure. That looks like a splendid table. Unfortunately, I'm at this table and...

PAT
This can't wait. We're on the verge of a breakthrough!
(Catching himself)
Oh. I shouldn't have said that.

LYNN
Breakthrough?

PAT
Forget I said that.

LYNN
Hmm. Yeah, sorry. Table's taken.

Pat stands frozen. His hand drifts toward the table, then pulls back.

PAT
Okay.

Pat walks away. But then turns around and comes back to Lynn's table.

PAT
I'm. I'm... a table whisperer. That's all I can say.
(Lynn waits.)
Like a horse whisperer. But different.

LYNN
Ah, yes. Of course. Why didn't you say so?

PAT
Didn't know if revealing— Well, there are rules.

LYNN
What rules?

PAT
Standard rules. Nothing out of the ordinary. Never initiate contact before nine AM. Never whisper in direct sunlight. Never—
(He stops himself.)
For protecting the...

LYNN
For protecting the table?

PAT
Well. Yeah.

LYNN
Glad you have the table's best interest in mind.

PAT
And that's why I need it.

LYNN
Right... About that. I'm a furniture whisperer. Kind of like a table whisperer, but different.

And you're interrupting a group session with this chair, that chair—
(She gestures to each.)
—and yes, the table.

PAT
(Glancing at one of the chairs)
That one seems... skeptical.

LYNN
She's been through a lot.

PAT
Group therapy? He never mentioned—

I guess I could wait until you finish.
(Beat.)
Mind if I sit in?

LYNN
Oh, I'm afraid not. The rules. You know.

PAT
Right... the rules.
(He nods too many times.)
Would you tell Fredrick that we'll have to reschedule for tomorrow?

LYNN
Who?

Pat stares at Lynn.

PAT
Who are you?

LYNN
Lynn. Who are you?

PAT
Why don't you know who Fredrick is?

LYNN
I do. Who are you?

PAT
But you— Fredrick would have mentioned me. We've been working together for three years. Every day. He would have mentioned me.

LYNN
He didn't.

PAT
I must ask you to leave. You're an imposter!

LYNN
I'm not.

PAT
You don't know the rules. Don't know your patient's name. You don't even—

Lynn closes her eyes. When she speaks, her voice shifts—flatter, colder.

LYNN
Fredrick says, "Shut the fuck up, Pat."

Pat stumbles backward. His hand finds a chair to steady himself.

PAT
He's never... he never talks to me like—
(Whispered)
How did you—

Lynn opens her eyes. Smiles. The warmth returns, but now it feels practiced.

LYNN
I'm very good at what I do.

Pat approaches the table slowly, reverently. He places his hand on it, closes his eyes, pushes down.

He pulls his hand away and looks under the table. There is a folded napkin under one leg.

PAT
(To the table, voice breaking)
She did this? She did this to you?

LYNN
Look. It's a group setting. That's probably why your name didn't come up.

PAT
(Pointing at the folded napkin)
You can't just put a bandaid on this issue. It's serious.

Fredrick knows it's serious. We were making progress. Real progress. And that— a dirty napkin? It's barbaric.

LYNN
I don't know which school of therapy you come from, but—

PAT
Barbaric!

Pat leans down to the table.

PAT
(Whispering)
Fredrick. Listen to me. You may feel better now, but it won't last. It's a cruel attempt to—

LYNN
Cruel? You want cruel?

She leans forward—too interested, too eager.

LYNN
Cruel is leading him on. Years of whispering. Years of "progress." When you could fix him now. Today.

PAT
It's not right! There is a process. There are rules!

LYNN
I know.
(She lets this sit.)
What if these rules prevented Fredrick from living his life?

PAT
They protect him!

LYNN
From what?

PAT
You're a monster!

LYNN
From what, Pat? What does Fredrick need protection from?

PAT
From— from—
(His voice cracks.)
From people who don't understand. Who see something broken and just want to... fix it. Slap a napkin under it and call it done. Like it's nothing. Like three years of— like he's nothing.

Lynn's expression softens. Something genuine, beneath the technique.

LYNN
He's not nothing.

PAT
Then why would you—

LYNN
Because sometimes the fixing is the problem.

Silence. Pat's hands are shaking.

LYNN
Listen. I know you mean well. But if you could help him now—really help him—and he was safe... wouldn't you? Even if the method was a bit unconventional?

You would, right?

PAT
(Quietly)
Of course.

LYNN
Of course you would.
(Beat.)
Join us?

PAT
But the rules.

Lynn looks around at the table and chairs.

LYNN
(Conspiratorial, almost playful)
We won't tell if you won't.

Pat assesses the situation. Lynn stands and moves a chair toward Pat.

Pat looks at the chair for a long moment.

PAT
(To the chair)
You don't mind, do you?

Pat's face softens—the first genuine ease we've seen.

PAT
Well, okay then.

Pat sits down on the chair. He nods to the other pieces of furniture, then turns to Lynn.

PAT
Okay. How does this work?

Lynn picks up her notebook and pen. She clicks the pen once. Twice.

LYNN
Well... Let's start with why you tried to escape.

Pat's face. The ease draining away. Something opening up—or closing forever.

BLACKOUT
