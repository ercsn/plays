PLACE AND TIME
Nondescript room with tables and chairs. Modern day.


CHARACTER BREAKDOWN (2)

PAT (M/F): A table whisperer on the verge of a breakthrough with his most important patient.
LYNN (M/F): A furniture whisperer whose methods challenge everything Pat believes about healing.




SYNOPSIS:
When Pat — a table whisperer on the verge of a breakthrough — discovers another practitioner treating his most important patient, a territorial dispute over method and meaning reveals what's really at stake.




Lights up on PAT alone at a table surrounded by empty chairs. Both hands pressed flat against it, eyes closed. His lips move silently. He's been here a while.

LYNN enters, notebook in hand. She watches Pat for a moment, then sits down across from him at the same table. She opens her notebook and begins writing.

Pat opens his eyes. Sees Lynn at his table. His hands leave the surface reluctantly, fingers trailing across the wood.

PAT
Excuse me, do you mind?

Lynn stops writing and looks up at Pat.

LYNN
Do I mind what?

PAT
(Motions to the table)
I've got some work to do.

LYNN
Welcome to the club.

PAT
No... I mean—
(He touches his collar, adjusts it. Adjusts it again.)
I have work to do with this table. So I need you to leave me alone with it.

LYNN
Alone with this table?

PAT
There are other tables. Great tables! Like that one over there.

LYNN
Sure. That looks like a splendid table. Unfortunately, I'm at this table and...

PAT
This can't wait. We're on the verge of a breakthrough!
(Catching himself)
Oh. I shouldn't have said that.

LYNN
Breakthrough?

PAT
Forget I said that.

LYNN
Hmm. Yeah, sorry. Table's taken.

Pat stands frozen. His hand drifts toward the table, then pulls back.

PAT
Okay.

Pat walks away. But then turns around and comes back to Lynn's table.

PAT
I'm. I'm... a table whisperer. That's all I can say.
(Lynn waits.)
Like a horse whisperer. But different.

Lynn's pen stops. She looks at Pat — really looks at him. Then:

LYNN
Ah, yes. Of course. Why didn't you say so?

PAT
Didn't know if revealing— Well, there are rules.

LYNN
What rules?

PAT
Standard rules. Nothing out of the ordinary. Never initiate contact before nine AM. Never whisper in direct sunlight. Never name a table after someone you've—
(He stops himself.)
For protecting the...

LYNN
For protecting the table?

PAT
Well. Yeah.

LYNN
Glad you have the table's best interest in mind.

PAT
And that's why I need it.

LYNN
Right... About that. I'm a—
(A brief pause. She chooses her next words.)
—furniture whisperer. Kind of like a table whisperer, but different.

And you're interrupting a group session with this chair, that chair—
(She gestures to each.)
—and yes, the table.

PAT
(Glancing at one of the chairs)
That one seems... skeptical.

LYNN
(Without missing a beat — meeting Pat in his world)
She's been through a lot.

PAT
Group therapy? He never mentioned—
(Pat looks at the table, then back at Lynn.)
I guess I could wait until you finish.
(Beat.)
Mind if I sit in?

LYNN
Oh, I'm afraid not. The rules. You know.

PAT
Right... the rules.
Would you tell Fredrick that we'll have to reschedule for tomorrow?

LYNN
Who?

Pat stares at Lynn.

PAT
Who are you?

LYNN
Lynn. Who are you?

PAT
Why don't you know who Fredrick is?

Lynn glances at the table. Back to Pat.

LYNN
I do. Who are you?

PAT
But you— Fredrick would have mentioned me. We've been working together for three years. Every day. He needs me.
(The weight of what he just said catches up to him.)
He would have mentioned me.

LYNN
He didn't.

PAT
I must ask you to leave. You're an imposter!

LYNN
I'm not.

PAT
You don't know the rules. Don't know your patient's name. You don't even—

Lynn closes her eyes. When she speaks, her voice shifts—flatter, colder.

LYNN
Fredrick says, "Shut the fuck up, Pat."

A long moment.

Pat stumbles backward. His hand finds a chair to steady himself.

PAT
He's never... he never talks to me like—
(Whispered)
How did you—

Lynn opens her eyes. She tilts her head, studies Pat the way she studied him when she first entered.

LYNN
Fredrick has a lot to say.

Pat approaches the table slowly, reverently. He places his hand on it, closes his eyes. He pushes down gently — testing the balance.

He pulls his hand away and looks under the table. There is a folded napkin under one leg.

PAT
(To the table, voice breaking)
She did this to you?

LYNN
Look. It's a group setting. That's probably why your name didn't come up.

PAT
(Pointing at the folded napkin)
You can't just put a bandaid on this issue. It's serious.

Fredrick knows it's serious. We were making progress. Real progress.
(Beat.)
And that— a dirty napkin? It's—

LYNN
I don't know which school of therapy you come from, but—

PAT
Barbaric!

Pat leans down to the table.

PAT
(Whispering)
Fredrick. Listen to me. You may feel better now, but it won't last. It's a cruel attempt to—

LYNN
Cruel? You want cruel?

She leans forward. Her hands press flat on the table — mirroring, consciously or not, how Pat touched it in the opening.

LYNN
Cruel is leading him on. Years of whispering. Years of "progress." When you could fix him now. Today.

PAT
It's not right! There is a process. There are rules!

LYNN
I know.
(She lets this sit.)
What if these rules prevented Fredrick from living his life?

PAT
They protect him!

LYNN
From what?

PAT
You're a monster!

LYNN
From what, Pat? What does Fredrick need protection from?

PAT
From— from—
(His voice cracks.)
From people who don't understand. Who see something broken and just want to... fix it. Slap a napkin under it and call it done. Like it's nothing. Like three years of— like he's nothing. Like I'm—
(Pat stops. His mouth closes. He steps back from the table.)

Lynn sets her pen down. She reaches toward Pat, then pulls her hand back.

LYNN
Pat, you're not—
(She catches herself. Returns to the table.)
He's not nothing.

PAT
Then why would you—

LYNN
When's the last time you let him speak?

Silence. Pat's hands are shaking.

LYNN
Listen. I know you mean well. But if you could help him now—really help him—and he was... safe... wouldn't you? Even if the method was a bit unconventional?

You would, right?

PAT
(Quietly)
Of course.

LYNN
Of course you would.
(Beat.)
Join us?

PAT
But the rules.

Lynn looks around at the table and chairs.

LYNN
(Conspiratorial, almost playful)
We won't tell if you won't.

Pat assesses the situation. Lynn stands and moves a chair toward Pat.

Pat looks at the chair. Then back at the table. He places his hand on it one last time. Holds it there.

He lets go.

PAT
(To the chair)
You don't mind, do you?

Pat's shoulders drop. He exhales.

PAT
Well, okay then.

Pat sits down on the chair. He nods to the other pieces of furniture, then turns to Lynn.

PAT
Okay. How does this work?

Lynn picks up her notebook and pen. She clicks the pen once. Twice.

LYNN
Well... Let's start with why you tried to escape.

Pat is still. His hands find the arms of the chair. He grips them.

Then, slowly, he lets go.

BLACKOUT
